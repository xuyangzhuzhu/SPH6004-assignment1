The reason why I named the data set with the "non-PCA" suffix is that I tried to perform PCA on the data set before, but later found that the effect was not good and adopted the non-PCA version. However, since the py files in the notebook are imported with the original file names, they have not been modified.

Model files all use the core suffix to refer to the correlation feature selection method.
